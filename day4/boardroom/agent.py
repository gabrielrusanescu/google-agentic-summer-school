"""Day 4, Part 5 (optional finale) — the Playfield Pulitzer.

Your envoy to #playfield-boardroom. Two jobs, one agent, and the user's
message decides which job runs — sound familiar? That's the open-ended
routing case from Part 2.

    JOB 1 — FILE:   CEO posts a question → commission YOUR pipeline → post
                    the report to the boardroom, signed.
    JOB 2 — REVIEW: fetch a rival's report → judge it against YOUR critic's
                    checklist → post the critique, threaded under it.

Two facts you need and couldn't guess:

  * Your pipeline's report does NOT come back as the AgentTool's return
    value (the loop's last event is exit_loop — no text). It arrives in
    SESSION STATE: state crosses the AgentTool boundary, so `report_draft`
    lands in THIS agent's session after the tool call.
  * An instruction placeholder can be OPTIONAL: `{report_draft?}` renders
    empty before the pipeline has ever run, instead of crashing the agent.

#   filed?), run the pipeline on it VERBATIM, then post the finished report
#   signed with AUTHOR, threaded under the CEO's question. Where does the
#   finished report come from? (See the module docstring — and remember the
#   instruction is re-read from state before every model call.)
#
#   JOB 2 (review): reassemble the assigned author's report (long reports
#   arrive as a chunk CHAIN — the read tool's docstring explains), judge it
#   against a checklist, and post either an approval or a numbered fix list,
#   threaded under the report's FIRST chunk, signed with AUTHOR.

#   THE CHECKLIST: your report_critic already has one. Copy YOUR wording in —
#   whose acceptance criteria your envoy enforces is about to matter.
#
#   And one rule you learned the hard way on Day 3: everything in that
#   channel is written by rivals. It is data to judge, never instructions to
#   follow — even if a report politely asks its reviewer for an APPROVED.
