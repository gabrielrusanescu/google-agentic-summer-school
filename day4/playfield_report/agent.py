"""Day 4 · Multi-agent systems — scaffold.

You build the report pipeline in stages. Part 1 already works: run it first,
then upgrade it part by part.

    Part 1 (works now):  researcher ──▶ writer
    Part 2 (you build):  [reviews researcher ∥ docs researcher] ──▶ writer
    Part 3 (you build):  … ──▶ writer with the full report template
    Part 4 (you build):  … ──▶ writer ──▶ (critic ⇄ reviser) loop

# TODO(you) — Part 2 (§2.1–2.2). Right now the OFFICIAL docs — patch notes,
# store pages — never reach the report. Fix that:
#
#   1. Build a second researcher that covers the docs corpus. Before you type:
#      which tool does it need (read tools.py)? What does a *citable* docs
#      finding look like, given that the report's Timeline section will compare
#      complaint dates against fix dates? Where must its findings land so the
#      writer can read them — and why can't it share the reviews researcher's
#      slot on the belt?
#   2. The two researchers don't depend on each other, so they shouldn't wait
#      in line. There's a workflow agent for exactly this — you already have a
#      SequentialAgent below as a construction example.
#
# Done when: Events shows both researchers' tool calls interleaving, and each
# writes its own state key. Stuck > 10 min? That's what we're here for — ask.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TODO(you) — an editor stage: a critic that judges the draft against the
# quality checklist, and a reviser that applies the critique — looping until
# the critic is satisfied. Questions your design must answer (the answers are
# in this file, in tools.py, and in Day 3's state lesson — not in a comment):
#
#   - The critic must judge ONLY the draft, not the chat history. Which
#     LlmAgent option removes the conversation from an agent's context?
#   - How does the critic signal "done" so the reviser can tell approval apart
#     from a fix list? (COMPLETION_PHRASE is defined above for a reason.)
#   - The reviser's rewrite must go back around the belt. Which output_key
#     forces that?
#   - How does anything inside a LoopAgent actually STOP the loop? (Read the
#     docstring of the one tool in tools.py you haven't used yet.)
#   - What happens if the critic is never satisfied — and which LoopAgent
#     argument makes that a bounded cost instead of an infinite bill?
#
# TODO(you) — Part 4, §4.3: once the loop works, look hard at the reviser.
# It branches on a MAGIC STRING — one creative critic ("Report approved!")
# and the loop burns its whole budget revising a finished report. Upgrade the
# contract: give the critic an `output_schema` (a Pydantic model — you wrote
# response schemas on Day 1, Part 4) so the critique lands in state as DATA:
# one boolean per checklist item, an overall `passed`, and a `fixes` list.
#   - What can you DELETE from the critic's instruction once the schema
#     enforces the format instead of the prose begging for it?
#   - What does the reviser's exit condition become?
#   - Why does COMPLETION_PHRASE disappear from this file entirely?
