"""Day 4, Part 2 side-quest — AgentTool: an agent used AS a tool.

Two ways to compose agents:

1. WORKFLOW agents (SequentialAgent, ParallelAgent, LoopAgent) — YOU fix the
   control flow in code. Deterministic, predictable, debuggable. That's the
   main track today (playfield_report).

2. AgentTool — the MODEL decides. A whole agent is wrapped as a tool of
   another agent; the parent calls it like any function when it judges it
   needs to. Flexible, and exactly as (un)predictable as any tool choice.

This demo is option 2: a concierge that can answer small questions itself but
delegates review-research to a wrapped specialist. Watch the Events tab: the
specialist's run appears nested inside the parent's tool call.

Rule of thumb: fixed process → workflow agents; open-ended routing → AgentTool.
